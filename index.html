	<h1>ABOUT</h1>
	<p>The idea of .flare came to life in Alberta, Canada by the owners of a small local and family-owned furniture shop. The owners, a father and his daughters are established lovers of nature and early on in their business they became obsessed with the beautiful wood found in Alberta: maple, oak and birch. With the hard work and the refined taste of the owners, .flar has today established its name in the industry.</p>
