Milestone Project 1: User Centric Development - Code Institute
# .flare Furniture - Minimalistic Timeless Furniture

This is my first project to present to Code Institute. The project highlights a pretend furniture website with a variety of products such as: chairs, sofas, shelving and desk.  

## Demo

## UX
My goal in the design was to make an interesting website possible, to realize an idea of a small, family-owned furniture store based out of my home country, Canada. The color scheme chosen is meant to represent natural materials, whilst providing a minimalistic, clean-cut design. The colours chosen are mostly natural and the design is simple. 

The website containes images of collections that the virtual/pretend .flare furniture online store offers to the customers. The range of products is organized in categories and the website is a scrollable one-page website devided in sections. It contains a testimonials section as well, reassuring clients of the high-quality products that .flare furniture custom makes. 

## Technologies used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (mainly 4)


## Features
This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap with the fixed navbar and a collapsible one when responsive. The sections are clearly highlighted through upon scroll and each sections contains original content written by me.

### Features Left to Implement
There are many features I'd like to implement in the near future, one of them being to make the website more 'lively' with background effects and smoother collapsible section with better optimized galleries of products. 


## Testing
The website is responsive on desktop and multiple devices excluding iPad and iPad Pro (right now). 
No links open with target="_blank" in a new tab, because the website is all one page and to have them open in a new tab felt unnecessary. 
Instead, the FIND OUT MORE button leads to the ABOUT section.
COLLECTION opens the gallery of pictures of furnitue. 
The logo in the footer takes the user back to HOME page and the CONTACT section does not gather any personal information. 

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the flare branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting "" into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.


## Credits

### Content
All content in every single section was written by me. Everything from ABOUT, FURNITURE, FABRICS AND MATERIALS, TESTIMONIALS and FOOTER.
The website's minimalistic and clean design is inspired by the Code Institute's final project. 

### Media
All photos were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), a stock image library, with the exception of some of the chairs and desks in the COLLECTIONS, which were taken from Google. 
The logo for this website is made by me using the following website: (https://www.hatchful.com/)
SVGs were taken from:(https://www.flaticon.com/), a stock icon library and I have tried my best to find and credit each author at the bottom of the html file. 

### Acknowledgements
The scrollSpy delay JavaScript function was found through the final project posted by Code Institute.
The media queries will have to be found somewhere too:
The website is inspire by the following online furniture stores:
