Milestone Project 1: User Centric Development - Code Institute
# .flare Furniture - Minimalistic Timeless Furniture

This is my first project to present to Code Institute. The project highlights a pretend furniture store website with a variety of custom-made pieces such as: chairs, sofas, shelving and desk. .flare furniture represents a small, family-owned business run out of Alberta, Canada. In the production of its furniture pieces, .flare uses only organic, recycled wood sourced locally from Canada. Likewise is true for the fabrics used to produce sofas, the cotton is eco-friendly fabric sourced by small, local organic cotton farms. 

This project is based solely on my imagination and desire to one day have such a business of my own. I toyed with the idea of the family-owned business as i grew up in a household of entrepreneurs and had them as inspiration. I also like the idea of supporting the local business owners and farmers therefore, I choose Canada, my home country.

## Demo
Live Demo of the website will be available as soon as I figure out how to do that. Or it might not be. 

## UX
My goal in the design was to realize an interesting idea, create a website based on a small, family-owned furniture store in Canada. I imagined a father and son spending days in their workshop, creating pieces for a variety of clients. The color scheme chosen is meant to represent natural materials used in furniture procution, whilst providing a minimalistic, clean-cut design. The colours chosen are mostly natural and the design is simple, so are the images used. 

The website is a scrollable one-page website devided in sections: Home, About (and Collections), Furniture, Materials and Fabrics, Testimonials and Contact. The About section opens up a section of images and collections that the virtual/pretend .flare furniture online store offers to its customers. Products are organized in ranges and categories (Chairs, Sofas, Shelves and Desks). Both Furniture and Fabric and Materials section tell more about the products offered as well as the materials used. The testimonials section contains two clients and the contact section does not collect emails and phone numbers or other personal data.

## Technologies used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (mainly 4)


## Features
This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap with the fixed navbar and a collapsible one when responsive. The sections are clearly highlighted through upon scroll and each sections contains original content written by me and my imagination.

### Features Left to Implement
There are many features I'd like to implement in the near future, one of them being to make the website more 'lively' with background effects and smoother collapsible section with better optimized galleries of products. I would also like to include an image in the About section that is aligned to the side, but with the landing page/home page image, I felt that the design would be too busy.


## Testing
The website is responsive on desktop and multiple devices whilst not fully responsive on iPad and iPad Pro (right now). Even though the website is responsive on both iPad and iPad Pro, there are some sections that I wish looked better on those devises, for example the testimonials, which overflow on the image.

No links open with target="_blank" in a new tab, because the website content is all one page and to have them open in a new tab felt unnecessary. 
Instead, the FIND OUT MORE button leads to the ABOUT section.
COLLECTION opens the gallery of pictures of furnitue. 
The logo in the footer takes the user back to HOME page and the CONTACT section does not gather any personal information. 
I wanted a clean design and a part of that is one that does not open new tabs when clicked on different sections.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the flare branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the flare branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`. I will merge the two branches when the project is fully finished.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting "" into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.


## Credits

### Content
All content in every single section was written by me. Everything from ABOUT, FURNITURE, FABRICS AND MATERIALS, TESTIMONIALS and FOOTER.
The website's minimalistic and clean design is inspired by the Code Institute's final project posted on GitHub.

### Media
All photos were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), a stock image library, with the exception of some of the chairs and desks in the COLLECTIONS, which were taken from Google. 
The logo for this website is made by me using the following website: (https://www.hatchful.com/)
SVGs were taken from:(https://www.flaticon.com/), a stock icon library and I have tried my best to find and credit each author at the bottom of the html file. 

### Acknowledgements
The scrollSpy delay JavaScript function was found through the final project posted by Code Institute.
The media queries were found in Code Institute videos and here:https://responsivedesign.is/develop/browser-feature-support/media-queries-for-common-device-breakpoints/ 
The website is inspired by the following online furniture stores:https://www.made.com/se/?gclid=CjwKCAjw0tHoBRBhEiwAvP1GFaSf4OOgO0dMNJi3nRS0gD5XLerhJP8vKex0ywQpdR__DdsSJDuufBoCmwgQAvD_BwE - especially when it comes to the design and the responsivness of the pages.
