Milestone Project 1: User Centric Development - Code Institute
# .flare Furniture - Minimalistic Timeless Furniture

This is my first project to present to Code Institute. The project highlights a pretend furniture store website with a variety of custom-made pieces such as: chairs, sofas, shelving and desks. .flare furniture represents a small, family-owned business run out of Alberta, Canada. In the production of its furniture pieces, .flare uses only organic, recycled wood sourced locally from Canada. Likewise is true for the fabrics used to produce sofas, the cotton is eco-friendly fabric sourced by small, local organic cotton farms. This is done with the intention to support local farmers and contribute to the country's economy.

This project is based solely on my imagination and desire to one day have such a business of my own. I toyed with the idea of the family-owned business as i grew up in a household of entrepreneurs and had my parents as inspiration. I also like the idea of supporting the local business owners and farmers therefore, I choose Canada, my home country. The business provides unique pieces that can be both passed onto future generations, but are as well minimalistic in style that they would fit into any household. 

## Demo
Live Demo of the website will be available as soon as I figure out how to do that. Or it might not be if I don't.

## UX
My goal in the design was to realize an interesting idea, create a website based on a small, family-owned furniture store in Canada. I imagined a father and son spending days in their workshop, creating pieces for a variety of clients. The color scheme chosen is meant to represent natural materials and bold fabrics used in furniture creation, whilst providing a minimalistic, clean-cut design. The colours chosen are mostly natural and the design is simple, so are the images used. 

-As a user type, I wanted to provide for an simple, easy to read and follow design. I included a COLLECTIONS section to provide an idea of the .flare furniture stile, with the images of the pieces featured.

-For the customers, I provided an inquiry section where they would be able to connect with .flare and write about their design ideas to then get an estimate of the price range. 

As for the links to the socials, the phone as well as the email icon lead to the CONTACT section, whereas the Instagram icon leads to ABOUT or COLLECTIONS section featuring furniture images.

The website is a scrollable one-page website devided in sections: Home, About (and Collections), Furniture, Materials and Fabrics, Testimonials and Contact. The About section opens up a section of images and collections that the virtual/pretend .flare furniture online store offers to its customers. Products are organized in ranges and categories (Chairs, Sofas, Shelves and Desks). Both Furniture and Fabric and Materials section tell more about the products offered as well as the materials used. The testimonials section contains two clients and the contact section does not collect emails and phone numbers or any other form of personal data.

## Features
This section discusses existing features, as well as the features left to implement.

### Existing Features

- ScrollSpy feature: This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap with the fixed navbar and a collapsible one when responsive. The sections are clearly highlighted through upon scroll and each sections contains original content written by myself.

The scrollSpy feature was inspired by the Code Institute Milestone final project. 

### Features Left to Implement

-Fix margin and padding-right in the collapsibble COLLECTIONS section, so that the images fit in better.
-Or create a separate page with the gallery. 
-Make website responsive for iPad and iPad Pro.
-Create a CONTACT section modal when submitting information that states no private information is being collected.

## Technologies used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (mainly 4)
4. Some JS files, all aditional files were inspired by the Code Institute's final project.

## Testing
The website is responsive on desktop and multiple devices whilst not fully responsive on iPad and iPad Pro (for right now). The testimonial overflow slightly on the clients' images. 

1. HOME:
i. Go to "FIND OUT MORE"
ii. The website takes you to ABOUT section

2. ABOUT:
i. Go to "COLLECTIONS"
ii. The website opens up a gallery of images sorted by the furniture category. Chairs, sofas, shelving and desks

3. NAVBAR:
i. Go to "FURNITURE"
ii. Read more about the types of furniture .flare provides

4. NAVBAR:
i. Go to "MATERIALS AND FABRICS"
ii. Read more about the types of materials, woods and fabrics (organic cotton) that .flare uses to create its pieces

5. NAVBAR:
i. Go to "TESTIMONIALS"
ii. Read testimonials of two different clients

6. CONTACT:
i. Enter your details, Full name, Email address
ii. Select a piece in mind, choose betwen chairs, sofas, shelving and desks
iii. Type your message in click the "SUBMIT" button.
iv. Try to omit name or email address, or even typing a message. A message will pop up saying "Please fill out this feild" until all mandatory fields are filled in. 

No links open with target="_blank" in a new tab, because the website content is all one page and to have them open in a new tab felt unnecessary. 
Instead, the FIND OUT MORE button leads to the ABOUT section.
COLLECTION opens the gallery of pictures of furnitue. 
The logo in the footer takes the user back to HOME page and the CONTACT section does not gather any personal information. 
I wanted a clean design and a part of that is one that does not open new tabs when clicked on different sections.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the flare branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the flare branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`. I will merge the two branches when the project is fully finished.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting "" into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
